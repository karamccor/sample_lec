## Why regression?

::: nonincremental
-   Regression is a way of learning about mechanisms, or driver(s), of an outcome. 
-   Typically use $X$ to denote the driver(s) and $Y$ to denote the outcome. 
-   We might refer to $X$ as the *independent variable*, *covariate*, *risk factor*, *predictor*, or *feature*. 
-   We might refer to $Y$ as the *dependent variable*, *response*, or *outcome*. 
:::

---

## Univariate regression

::: nonincremental
-   In univariate regression, we assume it is possible to clearly identify which variables are covariates and which are outcomes. 
-   However, this may not be possible.
-   For example, insomnia and depression. Does insomnia lead to depression? Or does depression lead to insomnia?
-   Multivariate approaches which jointly model more than one outcome may be appropriate. 
:::


---

## How can we use regression?

::: nonincremental
-   To quantify association
-   To explain variability
-   Estimate the effect of an intervention
-   Predict outcomes
:::


# Logistic regression

## Topics

::: nonincremental
-   Using logistic regression for a binary response
-   Odds vs. probabilities
-   Using logistic regression model
:::

---

## Logistic regression

::: nonincremental
-   Logistic regression is a **generalized linear model** where the outcome is a two-level categorical variable. 

-   The response $Y$ takes value 1 with probability $\pi$ and value 0 with probability $1-\pi$. 

-   $\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$: **odds** that $Y=1$

-   $\log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big)$: **log odds**

-   How do we get from $\pi$ to $\log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big)$? With the **logit transformation**.

## Odds to probabilities

**Odds**

$$\omega = \frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$$

**Probability**

$$\pi = \frac{\omega}{1+\omega}$$

## Acupuncture example 

::: incremental
-   The `openintro::migraine` dataset is from a study about ear acupuncture in treatment of migraine attacks. 
-   **Response**: `pain_free` = yes or no
-   **Predictor**: `group` = control or treatment
-   **Research question**: Is acupuncture treatment associated with a reduction of pain?
:::

## Exploratory Data Analysis

::: nonincremental
-   **Research question**: Is acupuncture treatment associated with a reduction of pain?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 4

migraine %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group, fill = pain_free)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "Proportion", 
       title = "Acupuncture vs. Pain_free") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", 
                    direction = -1) +
  coord_flip()

```

::: {.notes}
G. Allais et al. Ear acupuncture in the treatment of migraine attacks: a randomized trial on the efficacy of appropriate versus inappropriate acupoints. In: Neurological Sci. 32.1 (2011), pp. 173-175. 

The majority of the points were located on the antero-
internal part of the antitragus (area M) on the same side of pain. The aim of this study was to verify the therapeutic value of area M and to compare it with an area of the ear (representation of the sciatic nerve, area S) which probably does not have a therapeutic effect on migraine attacks.

## Modeling being pain-free

```{r}
#| echo: true

acu_model <- glm(pain_free ~ group, 
                  data  = migraine, 
                 family = "binomial")
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}}{1-\hat{\pi}}\Big) = -3.091 + 1.897 \times \text{treatment}$$
---

## Interpreting **treatment** coefficient - log odds

```{r}
#| echo: false
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```
The **log-odds** of being pain-free post-treatment are expected to be 1.897 higher for those who received treatment compared to those who did not receive treatment. 


---

## Interpreting **treatment** coefficient - odds

```{r}
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

The **odds** of being pain-free post-treatment for those who received treatment are expected to be 6.67 (i.e. exp(1.897)) times the odds for those who received the control.


---

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$ {.smaller}

**Hypotheses**: $H_0: \beta_j = 0$ vs $H_A: \beta_j \neq 0$

::: nonincremental
-   $H_0$: There is no linear relationship between the variable of interest and the log-odds of the response.

-   $H_A$: There **is** a linear relationship between the variable of interest and the log-odds of the response.
:::

**Test statistic**:

$$z = \frac{\hat{\beta_j}-0}{SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}$$

**P-value**: $P(|Z|>|z|)$, where $Z\sim N(0,1)$. 

---

## Confidence interval for $\beta_j$

Can calculate a **C% confidence interval** for $\beta_j$:

$$\hat{\beta_j} \pm z^* SE_{\hat{\beta_j}}$$

where $z^*$ comes from $N(0,1)$.


This is an interval for the change in log-odds of the response for a one-unit increase in $x_j$.

---

## Interpretation in terms of odds

The change in **odds** for every one-unit change in $x_j$. 

$$\exp{\hat{\beta}_j \pm z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}$$

**Interpretation**: We are $C$% confident that for every one-unit increase in $x_j$, the odds multiply by a factor of $\big\{\exp{\hat{\beta}_j - z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}\big\}$ to $\big\{\exp{\hat{\beta}_j + z^* SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}\big\}$, holding all other variables constant. 



---

## Let's look at the coefficient for treatment

```{r}
#| echo: false
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

**Test statistic**

$$z = \frac{1.897-0}{0.808}= 2.34778$$

---

## Let's look at the coefficient for treatment

```{r}
#| echo: false
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```


**P-value**

$$P(|Z| > |2.34778|)$$

```{r}
2 * pnorm(2.34778, lower.tail = FALSE)
```



---

## Let's look at the coefficient for treatment

```{r}
#| echo: false
acu_model %>%
  tidy %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

**Conclusion**: Since the p-value is quite small, we reject $H_0$. The data provide sufficient evidence that the treatment is a statistically significant predictor of being migraine-pain-free post-treatment.

- Pair up - two people per bingo card.
- Each square on bingo card has a question.
- "Answers" located throughout room. If you think you've found a correct answer, take a sticker and place it in the square. 
  -   Write a note on your card about what the answer said
- When you get bingo (3 in a row), shout it out and share your 3 question/answers. 
- If you'd like to see any slide from this lecture, feel free to ask!
