::: notes
I did my undergraduate studies at University of Miami in FL. Sports brought me to University of Miami, I was on the diving team, and this was a huge part of my identity at that time. I hadn't given much thought to my career after school. However, I always really liked math (after having some great teachers growing up) and decided to major in math. I worked in the math lab as a tutor and began to really liked tutoring. It felt great to be able to explain a concept to someone in a different way than they had thought about it before, and have it land and make sense. Toward the end of my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to do an incredible service opportunity over the summer that really sparked my interest in teaching.

::: notes
The program was called Coach for College. We traveled for three weeks to rural vietnam and help facilitate a summer school/sports camp for middle school kids, the goal being to promote higher education. During my time there, I taught physics and coached volleyball. Because of language barrier, we worked with translators to deliver each of the classes, and so it was a great opportunity to learn how to be succinct, and really think about how to fit in engaging activities with limited time.

::: notes
I went back to Miami, finished my last year of undergrad, and then got a Master's in math in order to be able to teach at the community college level. I spent a year as an adjunct instructor at Miami Dade College, with my first instructor-of-records being college algebra and calculus 1. The students I taught came from diverse backgrounds: some were straight out of undergrad to get an associate's, some were getting transfer credits to apply to a different institution, and many had kids and were returning to school after many years of not being in school.

After being an adjunct, I decided I wanted to teach at the college level, and decided to pursue a PhD in the biostats dept at Duke. There, I've had a number of wonderful teaching experiences, such as being a TA for undergrad and grad classes in the biostats and stats departments, as well as being a TA for bioinformatics courses.

-   Tools for collaboration

::: notes
That's brought me to where I am today. Drawing on my mathematics background, I really enjoy teaching intro to probability and statistics, as well as foundational statistical concepts such as regression. I enjoy teaching best coding practices and sharing tools to make statistical workflows more efficient and seamless. teach data visualization, I think being able to communicate your research through visual storytelling is incredibly important.
